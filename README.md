# RAGatouille: Local RAG & MCP Servers Solution

## Project Overview

RAGatouille is a locally deployable solution designed to empower users with their own knowledge base using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server. This project allows you to vectorize various data sources – including books, specifications, documentation, code, and web pages – to create a personalized, local knowledge base. The core unit of organization is a "collection," which can be configured with different embedders and chunking settings to optimize retrieval.

**Note:** This project is currently under active development, and many features are in pre-production.


## Key Features

*   **Vectorization of diverse data sources:** Books, specifications, documentation, code, web pages.
*   **Collection-based organization:** Manage your knowledge in logical, configurable units.
*   **Support for different embedders:** Choose the best embedding model for your specific needs.
*   **Configurable chunking settings:** Optimize how your documents are broken down for retrieval.
*   **User-friendly interface:** (Implied by frontend components) Easily manage collections and imports.
*   **API-driven backend:** Robust and extensible API for programmatic access.
*   **Docker/Podman compatibility:** Simple local deployment and management.
*   **MCP Server:** Acces from any AI agent

## Getting Started (Local Deployment)

To get started with RAGatouille, you will need Docker or Podman installed on your system or you can run servers locally.

*(Detailed instructions for Docker/Podman setup, building images, and running containers will go here. This will require further investigation or user input to provide accurate commands.) It is still under construction*

## Usage

*(Instructions on how to interact with the application, create collections, import data, and use the RAG/MCP features will go here. This will depend on the final implementation of the UI and API.)*

## Development Status

RAGatouille is an evolving project. While the core functionalities are in place, many features are still under active development and should be considered pre-production. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community.
