description = "Creates tasks from requirements and design for <issue_number>"
prompt = """

Analyze .design-specs/specs/requirements-{{args}}.md and .design-specs/specs/design-{{args}}.md and create a file tasks-{{args}}.md in folder .design-specs/specs/ int the root directory of this
project. The folder have already existed

**Important: DO NOT IMPLEMENT CODE IN THIS COMMAND!!**

## Tasks Creation

**Template to Follow**: Use the exact structure from `.design-specs/templates/tasks-template.md`

### Task Planning Process
1. **Load Previous Phases**
   - Load both .design-specs/specs/requirements-{{args}}.md and .design-specs/specs/design-{{args}}.md for complete context
   - Load steering .design-specs/structure.md, .design-specs/tech.md, .design-specs/codestyle.md for extra context

2. **Generate Atomic Task List**
   - Break design into atomic, executable coding tasks following these criteria:
   
   **Atomic Task Requirements**:
   - **File Scope**: Each task touches 1-3 related files maximum
   - **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes by an experienced developer
   - **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
   - **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
   - **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching
   
   **Task Granularity Examples**:
   - BAD: "Implement authentication system"
   - GOOD: "Create User model in models/user.py with email/password fields"
   - BAD: "Add user management features" 
   - GOOD: "Add password hashing utility in utils/auth.py using bcrypt"
   
   **Implementation Guidelines**:
   - **Follow structure.md**: Ensure tasks respect project file organization
   - **Prioritize extending/adapting existing code** over building from scratch
   - Use checkbox format with numbered hierarchy
   - Each task should reference specific requirements AND existing code to leverage
   - Focus ONLY on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
   - Break large concepts into file-level operations

3. Write created tasks to .design-specs/specs/tasks-{{args}}.md if file already exists update it.
