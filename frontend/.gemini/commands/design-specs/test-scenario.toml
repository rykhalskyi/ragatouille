prompt = """
Analyze the test scenario from `{{args}}` and implement a corresponding Playwright E2E test.

### 1. Research & Instrumentation
- Open `http://localhost:4200` with playwright mcp to locate the UI elements for each step.
- In `src/app/testing/test-ids.ts`, add any missing `data-testid` constants.
- In the relevant Angular components, import `TestIds` from `@testing/test-ids`, expose it to the template, and add the `[attr.data-testid]` attribute.

### 2. Test Implementation
- Create a new Playwright test in the `e2e/` directory.
- Use `page.getByTestId()` for all instrumented elements.
- For file uploads, use `page.locator('input[type="file"]').setInputFiles(filePath)`.
- Ensure all visibility and text assertions from the scenario are covered.
